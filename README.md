# Image-Captioning
This project is a deep learning-based Image Captioning Generator, developed and tested in Google Colab. It leverages powerful libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, and Matplotlib to generate meaningful textual descriptions from input images using a combination of CNN + RNN (LSTM) architecture.
